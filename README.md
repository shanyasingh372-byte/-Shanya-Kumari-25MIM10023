# Mini Cinema Ticket Booking System   

### Project Title  
**Mini Cinema Ticket Booking System**  

### Domain  
Entertainment & Retail / Basic Programming Practice  

### Description  
This is a console-based movie theater seat booking system built using **only basic Python concepts**. It simulates a small cinema with **5 rows × 6 seats = 30 seats** and allows users to:  
- View the current seat layout  
- Book a seat for one of four movies  
- See how many seats are booked/available  
- Prevent double-booking of the same seat  

Perfect for students learning:  
- Lists (including 2D lists)  
- Tuples  
- Loops (for, while)  
- Functions  
- Conditional statements  
- Basic input validation  

**No external libraries or advanced Python features are used.**

### Features  
1. Visual seat map ( [ ] = available, [X] = booked )  
2. Choose from 4 movies  
3. Book seats by row and seat number  
4. Input validation (prevents wrong numbers or letters)  
5. Booking statistics (total booked & available seats)  
6. Simple menu-driven interface  

### How to Run  
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
2. Save the code as `cinema_booking.py`  
3. Open terminal/command prompt and run:  
```bash
python cinema_booking.py
```
4. Follow the on-screen menu to book tickets!
